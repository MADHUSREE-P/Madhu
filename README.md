Abstract : This project delves into the analysis of Uber rides data using Python, aiming to uncover trends and patterns within the dataset. The analysis encompasses various aspects, including ride frequency, duration, geographical distribution, and peak hours. Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib are utilized for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Insights derived from this analysis can provide valuable information for optimizing service efficiency, identifying potential areas for expansion, and enhancing user experience within the Uber platform.
